Program Description:
    This program is designed to simulate the DFA in the Purple Dragon book (p. 141)
    and to simulate another DFA of my choosing. The program prompts the user to 
    enter a sequence of characters which each character will be processed
    to determine if it is valid or invalid in either DFAs. If the string 
    is empty or the amount of characters is less than 3, then the string
    will be automatically rejected as the languages for both DFAs require 
    to have at leastof length 3 or greater. This program uses a table driven
    approach to simulate the DFAs which makes it easier to do transtions to
    other states based on an given input.

To run the program type in:

    make lab1

and then do

    ./lab1

to execute the program and will prompt the user
to enter a string that either be accepted by either
DFAs.
