# Lab 1

DFAs are specified by a set of states (among them one starting and one
or more accepting), and transitions between pairs of states which are labeled
by a symbol of some alphabet. DFAs are typically given in one of two formats:

1. A transition diagram (that is a directed graph), and
2. A transition table.

Both representations are equivalant to each other.

## Exercise:

Write a program that simulates the above DFA in a language of your choice, but
limited to something that could run on the machines in the lab.
